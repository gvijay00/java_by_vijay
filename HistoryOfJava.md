### 1. History of Java
- Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** in **1991**.
- Initially called **Oak**, later renamed to **Java** in **1995**.
- Designed to be platform-independent and primarily used for embedded systems.
- Sun Microsystems released Java publicly in **1995**.
- In **2010**, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, making Java an Oracle product.
- Java versions have evolved over the years, with regular updates adding new features and improvements.

### 2. Introduction to Java
- **Java** is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent** programming language.
- It follows the **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)** principle using the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
- Java is widely used for **web development, mobile applications, enterprise applications, and embedded systems**.
- It is designed to be **simple, secure, and robust** with automatic memory management.
- Java code is first compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on the **JVM** rather than directly on the operating system.

### 3. Features of Java
1. **Platform Independence** – Java programs run on any system with a JVM.
2. **Object-Oriented** – Java follows OOP principles such as **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.
3. **Simple and Easy to Learn** – Java has a clean syntax, similar to C++ but without complexities like pointers.
4. **Robust and Secure** – Java includes features like exception handling and a security manager to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Automatic Memory Management** – Uses **Garbage Collection** to manage memory efficiently.
6. **Multithreading** – Java supports concurrent execution of multiple threads, improving performance.
7. **High Performance** – Though interpreted, Java uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation** for optimization.
8. **Distributed Computing** – Java provides APIs like **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** for network-based applications.
9. **Rich API** – Java has a vast collection of built-in libraries for various functionalities.
10. **Community Support** – A large developer community continuously contributes to Java’s growth and improvement.




Java has evolved significantly over the years, leading to different "flavors" or editions, each catering to specific application domains. Here are the main flavors of Java:  

### 1. **Java Standard Edition (Java SE)**
   - The core Java platform used for general-purpose programming.  
   - Includes essential libraries like collections, threading, networking, and JDBC.  
   - Used for desktop applications, command-line tools, and basic server-side applications.  

### 2. **Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) (Now Jakarta EE)**
   - Designed for large-scale, enterprise-level applications.  
   - Includes APIs for web services, servlets, JSP, EJB, JPA, and more.  
   - Used for building distributed, scalable, and secure web applications.  

### 3. **Java Micro Edition (Java ME)**
   - A lightweight version of Java used for mobile and embedded systems.  
   - Used in IoT devices, smart cards, and feature phones.  
   - Contains a subset of Java SE with optimizations for constrained environments.  

### 4. **JavaFX**
   - A modern UI framework for building rich internet applications (RIA).  
   - Replaces Swing and AWT for creating desktop applications with advanced UI features.  
   - Supports CSS, FXML, and integrates with web technologies.
