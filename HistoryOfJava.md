### 1. History of Java
- Java was developed by **James Gosling** and his team at **Sun Microsystems** in **1991**.
- Initially called **Oak**, later renamed to **Java** in **1995**.
- Designed to be platform-independent and primarily used for embedded systems.
- Sun Microsystems released Java publicly in **1995**.
- In **2010**, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, making Java an Oracle product.
- Java versions have evolved over the years, with regular updates adding new features and improvements.

### 2. Introduction to Java
- **Java** is a **high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent** programming language.
- It follows the **WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere)** principle using the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
- Java is widely used for **web development, mobile applications, enterprise applications, and embedded systems**.
- It is designed to be **simple, secure, and robust** with automatic memory management.
- Java code is first compiled into **bytecode**, which runs on the **JVM** rather than directly on the operating system.

### 3. Features of Java
1. **Platform Independence** – Java programs run on any system with a JVM.
2. **Object-Oriented** – Java follows OOP principles such as **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**.
3. **Simple and Easy to Learn** – Java has a clean syntax, similar to C++ but without complexities like pointers.
4. **Robust and Secure** – Java includes features like exception handling and a security manager to prevent unauthorized access.
5. **Automatic Memory Management** – Uses **Garbage Collection** to manage memory efficiently.
6. **Multithreading** – Java supports concurrent execution of multiple threads, improving performance.
7. **High Performance** – Though interpreted, Java uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation** for optimization.
8. **Distributed Computing** – Java provides APIs like **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** for network-based applications.
9. **Rich API** – Java has a vast collection of built-in libraries for various functionalities.
10. **Community Support** – A large developer community continuously contributes to Java’s growth and improvement.

Java continues to evolve with new versions introducing enhanced performance, security, and modern programming features.
